# Colour-detection-using-OpenCV

The project aims to detect colours in an image. It uses python libraries like OpenCV, numpy and pandas.
The dataset contains colour's name with its hexadecimal values. The function will find the RGB values of
the pixel clicked and then find its equivalent valued colour from the dataset and will display it RGB values and its name.
You can run the python file from the command prompt and should also give the file path to detect colours.
